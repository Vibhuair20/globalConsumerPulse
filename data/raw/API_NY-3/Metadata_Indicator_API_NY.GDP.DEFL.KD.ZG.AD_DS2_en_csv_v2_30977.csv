"NY.GDP.DEFL.KD.ZG.AD","Inflation, GDP deflator: linked series (annual %)","Inflation as measured by the annual growth rate of the GDP implicit deflator shows the rate of price change in the economy as a whole. The GDP implicit deflator is the ratio of GDP in current local currency to GDP in constant local currency. This series has been linked to produce a consistent time series to counteract breaks in series over time due to changes in base years, source data and methodologies. Thus, it may not be comparable with other national accounts series in the database for historical years. This indicator denotes the percentage change over each previous year of the constant price (base year 2015) series in United States dollars.","Staff estimates, World Bank (WB);
